## Description
The cute animated design-inspired mood-tracking app allows users to input their daily thoughts and emotions through emojis and journal writing.

## App Concept
**Use Case**: The app helps users develop a habit of self-reflection and emotional awareness by providing a simple, visually appealing way to track their daily moods and thoughts.
Individuals aged 13 and above who enjoy introspection and journaling, as well as those seeking a supportive tool to track and better understand their emotions.

## MoodMoji Development Process 
The development process for MoodMoji was fast-paced and efficient, taking us just under two weeks, as initially planned for the Code Lab. We started by dividing the tasks between us, so we knew exactly what each of us had to focus on.

By day 3, we had already set up the database and completed most of the design, along with a few smaller details. By the end of the first week, the app was nearly done. We only had a few minor issues left to address and the user testing to go through.

By the day before our final presentation, the app was fully functional. We managed to test it with five users, all the features were working smoothly, and the app was ready to be downloaded.


## Database 
![Database](database.jpg)

The MoodEntity ID is auto-generated and distinct from the emoji ID. The EmojiId corresponds to the Emoji class, EmojiId=id(Emoji class), which is assigned a number ranging from 1 to 12. The properties associated with each emoji are retrieved from the database based on the saved EmojiId.


## Heuristic Evaluation
**Strenghts:** 
- The use of emojis for mood tracking is intuitive, making it engaging and easy for users to understand and interact with.
- A clean and consistent design across the app improves usability and reduces cognitive load.

**Weaknesses:**
- Some actions, like deleting entries, lack a confirmation step, which could lead to accidental mistakes.
- The app currently offers a limited set of features, which may not fully meet the needs of users looking for deeper emotional analysis or reporting.

## Test Setup
The usability test was conducted with 5 participants, focusing on understanding how they interact with the app and identifying any usability issues in the user flow, focusing on tasks such as adding an entry with an emoji and notes, editing and deleting a journal entry and more.

## Target Group
- Age: 13+
- Interests: Mood tracking, self-reflection, journaling

## Hypothesis and Questions
**Hypotheses**:
1. Journaling alongside emojis will enhance users’ reflection on their emotions, encouraging deeper self-awareness.
2. The calendar-based navigation system will allow users to easily access and navigate their mood records over time.

**Questions**:
1. Are users able to complete the "Add Mood" and "Update" actions without external help?
2. Does the app encourage consistent mood tracking over time?

## Metrics
1. Task Completion Rate
2. Error Rate
3. SUS Score
4. Qualitative Feedback


## Tasks
**Task 1:** Open the calendar and select a date to view its details;

**Task 2:** Add a new mood for today and write a short note;

**Task 3:** Update an old journal entry;

**Task 4:** Delete today's entry; 

**Task 5:** Edit a journal entry through the journal view.

After all of the tasks were realized, testers were given a SUS and post-task questionnaire.
